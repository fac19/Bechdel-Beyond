## What is the Bechdel Test? :female_sign: 

![image alt](https://media.giphy.com/media/J2n6TpRkDnBmYJeSG5/giphy.gif)

This simple test, also known as the Bechdel-Wallace test, was created by the cartoonist Alison Bechdel and her friend Liz Wallace. It is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. 

A movie passes when:
1. The movie has to have at least two women in it,
1. who talk to each other,
1. about something other than a man.



## What is Beyond? :rocket: 

The Bechdel Test is a useful but limited tool as it doesn't tell the whole story. The beyond part of our review asks the user to think about other criteria such as:


* How many women are in the cast/crew?
* What percentage of the dialogue do they speak?
* Do they drive their choices?

### Tech Used
- React
- Jest
- CodeCov
- Travis



### Future developments

With more time we would: 

- Add a user page - user can edit their details, see all their reviews and edit/delete them
- Filter function so users can filter by gender ratio/ director's gender etc.
- Add playlist feature - user can create playlists of movies they like and view playlists created by other users
- Use infographics to display the gender parity data

Planning was done on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Bechdel-and-beyond-fcacd0381bb04b5089cdb0062609fdba) and [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ks1wjnI=/)

**You can find the backend API for this app [here](https://github.com/fac19/Bechdel-Beyond-backend)**

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
