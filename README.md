## What is the Bechdel Test? :female_sign: 

![image alt](https://media.giphy.com/media/J2n6TpRkDnBmYJeSG5/giphy.gif)

This simple test, also known as the Bechdel-Wallace test, was created by the cartoonist Alison Bechdel and her friend Liz Wallace. It is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. 

A movie passes when:
1. The movie has to have at least two women in it,
1. who talk to each other,
1. about something other than a man.



## What is Beyond? :rocket: 

The Bechdel Test is a useful but limited tool as it doesn't tell the whole story. The beyond part of our review asks the user to think about other criteria such as:


* How many women are in the cast/crew?
* What percentage of the dialogue do they speak?
* Do they drive their choices?

### Tech Used
- React
- Jest
- CodeCov
- Travis


### Future developments

With more time we would: 

- Add a user page - user can edit their details, see all their reviews and edit/delete them
- Filter function so users can filter by gender ratio/ director's gender etc.
- Add playlist feature - user can create playlists of movies they like and view playlists created by other users
- Use infographics to display the gender parity data
